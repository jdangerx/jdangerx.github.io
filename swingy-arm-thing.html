    <p>I was in an art class last quarter, taught by <a href="http://www.hannahgivler.com">Hannah Givler</a>. </p>
<p>This project is called "Module Matters". The prompt is to make a
reproducible module that can be used as a building block or an
integral part of a sculpture.</p>
<p>Initially I was doing a bunch of research on 3-D tiling, but I got distracted by
magnets and started thinking about cool magnetic things instead. After some
excited discussion with my friend Rachel I decided to CAD up a swingy arm thing
with magnets. The basic idea is that I have a stack of rotating arms
with magnets in their ends - this causes them to be loosely coupled in that
strange magnetic way. Then when you move any of the arms, the others move with
it. It's reminiscent of the
<a href="http://exs.exploratorium.edu/exhibits/magnetic-wave-machine/">Magnetic Wave Machine</a>
at the Exploratorium.</p>
<p>I printed out a template from SolidWorks and traced that onto a scrap piece of lauan.</p>
<p><img src="images/swingy-arm-thing/paper-template.jpg"/></p>
<p>I cut it out with a bandsaw, then sanded it down.  Then I nailed a few
pieces of scrap together, using the template as a template, to make a
quick jig so I can drill holes precisely.</p>
<p><img src="images/swingy-arm-thing/lauan-in-jig.jpg"/></p>
<p>Then I traced the template 10 times onto a 2'x4' piece of 3/4" plywood, and cut
them all out with a bandsaw.</p>
<p><img src="images/swingy-arm-thing/rough-cut.jpg"/></p>
<p>Then I used the template to route out the pieces smoothly, before
putting them in the drilling jig to make the pockets for the magnets
and bearings.  I used skateboard bearings, because they're cheap and
easy to find. They take 8mm axles, which is just a smidge bigger than
the 5/16" threaded rod I used for the axle. The arms were spaced out
with washers between the bearings and secured with a nut on each end.</p>
<p>Here is some video of the first few arms, hanging out in the joining
table:</p>

<p>I hadn't really thought about how I would mount the piece. After a
discussion with my professor I decided to cobble together some 2x4's
and call it a day. I'm not proud of that, but the truth is the truth.</p>
