This quarter I am in [Jason Salavon](http://www.salavon.com)'s Data
and Algorithm in Art class. This is a group project I did with
[Clare Koury](http://clarekoury.tumblr.com) and Rebeca Carillo.

We hooked up a PC fan to an Arduino and had it pulse briefly every
couple seconds. The fan had a magnet attached to it.

On top of the fan we put a CD spindle with some
[rheoscopic fluid](http://www.instructables.com/id/Making-Rheoscopic-Fluid/?ALLSTEPS)
in it. To agitate the liquid we used
[Shapelock](http://shapelock.com/) to encase another magnet. Basically
we made a magnetic stirrer that only worked part of the time.

Here is a video of me discovering that the fan goes too fast for the
magnetic coupling. We solved this by pulsing the fan for about 40ms.

Then we made a pedestal for it, added a camera that provided a live
feed to a projector, and shined a bright light on it. All the pieces
came together in about half an hour. It working at all was pretty
surprising, I thought, so when people thought it had artistic merit as
well I was doubly suprised.
