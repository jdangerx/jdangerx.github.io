This will be a short overview of a couple 3D printer projects I have
undertaken in the past few years.

## Mendel Prusa
    * sourcing parts
    * the structural transistors
  * prusa
    * using a commercial 3D printer
      * giant objet machine
      * rubbery support material that had to be removed
  * printrbot+
    * jury-rigged a z-stop holder
    * had a jamming extruder
      * herringbone gears!
      * tried all sorts of things to avoid dremeling the gear teeth
        * maybe the bolt isn't sitting straight?
        * maybe the hole is off-center?
        * maybe the motor needs to wobble more?
      * dremeled the gear teeth that had white powder on them
    * plans for improvement
      * glass bed
      * better power source
      * upgrade hot end
      * bowden tube

  * plan for new one
    * linear rails
    * corexy with spectra
      * should avoid torquing of carriage, and spectra should help with crossing
        belts
      * might print some stuff to attach spectra to steel shaft without drilling
        a hole through it
    * bowden... may test out direct drive
