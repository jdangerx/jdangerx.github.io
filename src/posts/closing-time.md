# Closing Time

At my last job I worked on an online marketplace. It was a big deal if the site
went down, even if it was just for a few minutes in the middle of the night.

Once, I joked, "Why do we have to be up all the time anyways? Don't our users go
to sleep too? And what's the big deal if they can't buy something?"

This was met with some strained laughter. But seriously, it wasn't like we were
Amazon or anything.

Right?

But does *Amazon* need to be open 24/7?

This morning I made a [Firefox
add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/closing-time/). When you
access Amazon outside of business hours of its physical locations, it sends you
to a static "we're closed" page.

Discussion questions:

1. There are times during the day when you can go to Amazon.com on the Internet
   but can't find a bathroom in real life. Is it weird to be able to buy
   anything at any time? Why or why not?
2. Should machines get to rest?
3. Does this change our expectations for how the rest of the world works? How so?
