# Recurse Center Revue: Week 4

I've finally settled into things. Here's a quick list of what I've
worked on at RC:

* Learning TLA+, a formal specifications language
* Writing a small browser extension to ruin Google Calendar
* Working out some sort of chore rotation at RC
* Organizing "Great Thoughts Club," a space largely for navel-gazing
  about the direction of technology which might lead to some action
  down the line.
  
Let's go through these briefly:

## Learning TLA+

TLA+ is a formal specification language, often described as "rigorous
pseudocode." The basic idea is that you can use tools to help you
think about the design of your code - instead of checking to see that
the code is doing what you want it to do, we can check if what you
want it to do is *really* what you want it to do.

I haven't gotten too far with this yet. I got stuck at a point where I
was not really sure how to use it in a real project, but didn't want
to read the book anymore. My plan was to maybe use it for some toy
algorithms problems first, then build up from there. When I took
another look at the book yesterday, I found that this was exactly what
the next few chapters were going to be about. I guess Hillel's a
pretty smart guy and anticipated my problems, I just didn't want to
listen.
