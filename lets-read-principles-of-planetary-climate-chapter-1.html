to write some sparse notes on the chapters as I go through. It's like
live-blogging. I am live-blogging a textbook. I hope this is

<h3><a name="1.1"></a>1.1 - Overview</h3>
<p>This chapter will mostly be pointing out interesting things
and then assuring me that everything will be explained later in the
book. "We hope not to be too Earth-centric," he says. This is promising.</p>
<h3><a name="1.2"></a>1.2 - Close to Home</h3>
<p>This is a chapter that is mainly simple questions with interesting
answers. There are lots of questions we can ask about how the Earth
works just based in our everyday experience. For example, what causes
the seasons? Why is it warmer sometimes than others? Does the Sun warm
the Earth? What cools the Earth? If nothing cools the Earth, how do we
avoid just getting hotter and hotter? and other basic questions that
people have been asking for millenia.</p>
<p>There's a quick detour into different temperature scales (Celsius
vs. Kelvin vs. Fahrenheit) and talks about their advantages and
disadvantages.</p>
<p>What's the deal with air? How does it affect the climate of a planet?
The Moon doesn't have air, how hot/cold does it get? Very. We know
this because we can look at the heat radiating from it. This also answers
our earlier question about what cools the Earth.</p>
<p>Now we can think about how the existence of an atmosphere and its
composition affects the cooling of a planet, and here is the first
mention of greenhouse gases.</p>
<h3><a name="1.3"></a>1.3 - Into DEEPEST TIME: Faint Young Sun and Habitability of the Earth</h3>
<p>The Solar System is constantly changing. There's a quick rundown of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Earth">Earth's formation and early years</a>. The big point is that liquid water
has been widespread on Earth pretty consistently for at least the last
3 billion years, and sporadically for even longer.</p>
<p>This is kind of surprising! 3 billion years is a long time and, in
fact, the sun was about 20% dimmmer back then. This should make the
Earth too cold to have liquid water on the surface. There must have
been incredible amounts of greenhouse gases early on to keep the Earth
warm. But that atmosphere would be stiflingly hot today, so somewhere
in there the atmospheric composition has undergone massive changes.</p>
<h3><a name="1.4"></a>1.4 - Goldilocks in Space: Earth, Mars, and Venus</h3>
<p>Historically we have often viewed Venus as a pleasant and habitable
place not unlike Earth, but as we now know it's... not. We also know
that Mars is really cold.</p>
<p>So we see that we are kind of in between two extremes. The big
question here is: what "went wrong" on Venus and Mars, and how did we
somehow avoid both fates?</p>
<p>Some interesting, smaller questions that might help us answer the big
one include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Venus has a very new surface - by this I mean that there are not a
  lot of craters around. "The crust may have been engulfed and
  resurfaced as recently as 500 million years ago," says the book. Why
  did this happen on Venus but not on Earth?</li>
<li>We see that there was once liquid on Mars, a long time ago. But this
  was when the Sun was dimmer. So there must have been a very dense,
  greenhousey atmosphere. What happened to it? We'll touch on this
  later, apparently.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also talk briefly about Venus' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaway_greenhouse_effect">runaway greenhouse effect</a> here. I am
glad it did not occur here, though I am interested in the specifics of
why not. Pierrehumbert keeps bringing up how cool theories come from
combining different bits of basic science in novel ways.</p>
<h3><a name="1.5"></a>1.5 - Other Solar System Planets and Satellites</h3>
<p>Let's talk about gas giants! Apparently the atmospheric flow really
affects their thermal structure, which could be pretty cool later on.
Long-lived storms like the Great Red Spot are also
interesting. Unfortunately, there isn't going to be much fluid
dynamics in this book, though I guess I can finally finish reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-Leaf-Steven-Vogel/dp/0226859398/">The
Life of a Leaf</a> to get some intuition for this stuff.</p>
<p>I had learned of Uranus and Neptune as "gas giants" but here he
reclassifies them as "ice giants" because of their
composition. They're made of an "ice mantle", which is both (a) a
great name for a Magic card and (b) "actually a hot, slushy mixture"
more like a "water-ammonia ocean."</p>
<p>Here's a cool way of thinking of these four planets: on each of these,
there is a temperature gradient from cold to hot as you go deeper into
the atmosphere. Thus there is a band of altitude where the temperature
is appropriate for liquid water. So life could presumably exist
there. Pierrehumbert points out that, after all, life originated in
the oceans here on Earth.</p>
<p>Now we talk about Titan and Europa. Titan with its methane oceans,
full hydrological cycle, and dense nitrogen atmosphere (how is that
even still around?); Europa with its ice crust and liquid water
mantle. My favorite line of this book so far is: "At the cold
temperatures of Europa's surface, as on Titan, water ice is basically
a rock, just as sand can be considered an 'ice' of SiO<sub>2</sub> on Earth."
Really blowing my Earth-centric mind.</p>
<p>And of course, he ends this section with this: "these moons are, as
has been said, 'always icy, never dull.'"</p>
<h3><a name="1.6"></a>1.6 - Farther afield: Extrasolar Planets</h3>
<p>There's a bit about exoplanet detection and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution">stellar evolution</a>
here. Basically we are looking for planets orbiting relatively stable
stars at appropriate orbits. Turns out we haven't found any at the
time of this book's publishing, but we are really churning out the
exoplanet discoveries nowadays so who knows? In any case these planets
present interesting new climates to study, and new edge cases for us
to think about our theories with. Exoplanets are just really far away
and so it's pretty hard to get details about them (and it's incredible
that we've learned as much as we have).</p>
<h2><a name="1.7"></a>1.7 - Digression: About Climate Proxies</h2>
<p>So we haven't really done a great job, as a species, of recording the
climate history of the Earth. Especially since we haven't been around
for pretty much all of it. But the Earth itself, and other lifeforms
that have been on it, have been shaped by the climate, and we can use
such <em>climate proxies</em> to infer some details of the climate in the
distant past. And of course people are figuring out new ways to do
this as I write.</p>
<p>For example, certain animals are cold-blooded, so they can't live in
cold climates, so if we find them in the fossil record at a time we
know that it can't have been that cold, then and there. Or some
animals use different substances to make their shells based on the
temperature and we can analyze that. Of course these assume that the
biology of these animals is not too different from the ones we see
today, which admittedly is a little sketchy.</p>
<p>We can also look at sediments - if we see rocks that have deformed
what was once the ocean floor, we know that they were probably carried
out onto the open ocean by ice floes. That tells us something about
the temperature at that time as well.</p>
<p>We can even look at the chemical composition of the ocean that is
preserved in the ocean floor - but we need to be careful to avoid
being misled by samples that have been altered by later contact with
the ocean.</p>
<p>We can also look at differences between isotopes to see some
interesting effects. For example, lighter isotopes tend to be more
reactive as they have higher velocity at the same temperature. They
also evaporate and leave the atmosphere more easily. There are also
subtle effects in that some reactions prefer different isotopes based
on the temperature, and, as such, we can infer the temperature at the
time the reactions occured in a sample by looking at the isotopic
distribution.</p>
<p>For example, photosynthesis likes lighter carbon, so the carbon in
plants is lighter than the carbon in the air (all this is by very
small amounts, like 0.25%). Carbon participates in "the carbon cycle,"
which involves carbon being outgassed from the Earth and then buried
again somehow.</p>
<p>We know that carbon is outgassed from the Earth with a specific
isotope fraction. We also know that carbon is basically either buried
as organic matter or as a carbonate, so if we look at the isotope
fractions of both organic matter and a carbonate at a certain time we
can figure out the isotope fraction of the air at the time too!</p>
<p>This lets us find anomalies known as "carbon isotope excursions",
which tend to correspond to times when the carbon cycle was disturbed
somehow.</p>
<p>The amount of ice and the ocean temperature also affect the isotope
fraction of ocean water, which is preserved in certain fossils, so we
can use these fossils to determine those aspects about our water
supply in the distant past. Unfortunately it is difficult to tell the
effect of ice and the effect of water temperature apart, so there is
some sleuthing involved here. Turns out that the fossils we use are
easily distinguishable between the ones that live on the surface and
the ones that live on the sea floor. The sea floor has a much more
stable temperature than the surface, so we can compare the readings
from the two different types of fossils to get a better idea of the
true temperature. Additionally, there are times during which, by other
means, we can determine that there was little to no ice coverage. Then
any isotope fraction effects must be due to temperature.</p>
<p>Ok! Now that we know a bit more about how we know about the past, we
can get back to talking about the past.</p>
<h3><a name="1.8"></a>1.8 - The Proterozoic Climate Revisited: Snowball Earth</h3>
<p>This picture from Wikipedia represents the major bits of geological
time that will be important.
<img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Geologic_Clock_with_events_and_periods.svg/803px-Geologic_Clock_with_events_and_periods.svg.png" /></p>
<p>A short aside on continents! We haven't talked about them
yet. Pierrehumbert says "continents consist of light material that has
floated to the outer portions of the solid Earth and beeen
incorporated into the crust."  I'd learned that the crust was floating
on top of the mantle in Magic School Bus, but had never realized that
meant that the mantle was denser than the crust.</p>
<p>While they are floating around on the outside of the Earth the
continents are also affecting the climate. They are the primary place
where weatherable rocks are weathered, regulating atmospheric
CO<sub>2</sub>; they affect the shape of the oceans and how they
transport heat across the Earth; and they allow for new forms of life
which affect the climate in myriad ways.</p>
<p>We only really know what the continents looked like starting from the
end of the Proterozoic (still about 600 Mya!).</p>
<p>During the Proterozoic, the atmosphere and oceans became more
oxygenated. Life and the climate had to adjust to accomodate
this. This oxygenation occured in spurts, and by the end of the
Proterozoic the atmosphere was probably about as oxygen-rich as the
one today.</p>
<p>By looking at climate proxies we find there is lots of activity at the
beginning and end of the Proterozoic (the Paleoproterozoic and
Neoproterozoic, respectively). However, the billion years between
these two are known as "the most boring period in Earth history."
Pierrehumbert calls it the Big Yawn. If we knew more about it, we
would probably be able to find all sorts of interesting things going
on, but as it stands, we have no evidence of excitement during this
period. No glaciation, no anything. Eukaryotic life does appear at the
very beginning of this but don't seem to have caused a splash - maybe
they were the cause of this incredibly long period of stability.</p>
<p>In any case, at the beginning of the Proterozoic there was a Great
Oxidation Event. There's tons of evidence. For example, banded iron
formations, which require low oxygen levels, abruptly stop occurring
at the beginning of the Proterozoic. We see huge carbon excursions,
indicating a huge transition in the carbon cycle, such as a large
increased proportion of organic carbon burial. It looks like the
oxygen levels skyrocketed and then crashed again as the banded iron
formations returned. We see several periods of glaciation, one of
which (called the Makganyene) sees glaciers even in the tropics.</p>
<p>By 1.7 Bya we see that the atmosphere has about 10% as much oxygen as
it does now. Before the Proterozoic it was closer to 0.001%, so 10% is
pretty high. This number stays constant throughout the Big Yawn, until
700 Mya.</p>
<p>The Neoproterozoic brings back the excitement of the Paleoproterozoic,
with carbon excursions, glaciations, and more. There's a mysterious
carbon isotope excursion that is not associated with any "Snowball
event." It's called the "Shuram excursion," and during this time the
carbon in the carbonates (which tends to be heavy, remember, to offset
the light organic carbon) was 1.2% lighter than our standard
measurement. In a typical Snowball event we see the carbonates at
maybe -0.5%, so this is a Big Deal. We have no idea what happened -
the best guess is that there was "a transient reorganization of the
carbon cycle, in which a large isotopically light pool of suspended
organic carbon in the ocean is oxidized and deposited as carbonate."</p>
<p>Lots of stuff is going on with the oxygen, too. It's hard to tell
exactly, but what we do know for sure is that by the end of the
Neoproterozoic oxygen levels everywhere, down to the bottom of the
ocean, were similar to present levels.</p>
<p>Pierrehumbert: "A very Big Question is why all this excitement
 suddenly resumed after a billion years of stasis."</p>
<p>There are also lots of Big Questions specifically about Snowball
events, where the Earth is frozen over. How do they start? After
starting how do they end again? Is it guaranteed that they do end, or
have we just been lucky with them so far?</p>
<h3><a name="1.9"></a>1.9 - The Hothouse/Icehouse Dichotomy</h3>
<p>Though we are used to our current ice caps, we should recognize that
for significant parts of Earth's history, the poles were warm enough
that the poles were not frozen. About 50 million years ago, for
example, we use oxygen isotope information to calculate that, even at
the poles, the coldest temperature was around 15 C or 60 F. So the
poles were ice-free, even in the winters. This sort of climate is
known as a "hothouse climate."</p>
<p>A few million years before this point there was a sudden dip in heavy
oxygen - this indicates a spike in temperature of about 4 C. It's
called the PETM (Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum) and took about
10,000 years to spike and 200,000 years to subside again. We're not
sure what caused it and have seen nothing else as drastic as it. For
some context consider that between 1920 and 2005 we have increased the
Earth's surface temperature by almost 1 C. That's less than 100
years, or 1% of the time it took the PETM to set in.</p>
<p>The opposite, a climate where there is ice at the poles, is known as
an "icehouse climate." We are in one of these now.</p>
<p>Some things to look forward to: we'll be looking at the science of the
dinosaur asteroid's effect on climate, and at different possible
theories of the PETM. Eventually.</p>
<p>Once we hit the Phanerozoic, 600 Mya, we have a decent idea of what
the continent(s) looked like. <a href="http://cpgeosystems.com/globehighres.html">Here</a> is a cool site where you can
look at maps of what the Earth looked like back then. It's probable
that this changing geography influenced climate. Surely having no land
at the poles makes it difficult for glaciers to exist. On the other
hand, we get land at the poles long before we get ice caps and
significant glaciers, so this is not the only factor in
icehouse/hothouse transitions. CO<sub>2</sub> is a likely
suspect. There's a lot to say about hothouses and icehouses, and their
role in the evolution of the biosphere, but in a recurring theme,
we'll touch on it later as we've learned more of the science.</p>
<h3><a name="1.10"></a>1.10 - Pleistocene Glacial-Interglacial Cycles</h3>
<p>It is important to remember that "icehouse" is not the same as an "ice
age." An icehouse climate is simply a climate where we have permanent
ice at one or both poles for millions of years. An ice age is a surge
in ice sheet volume during an icehouse climate. The time between ice
ages is called an interglacial, even though glaciers and ice caps
still exist.</p>
<p>We start to see these ice ages about 4 million years ago. I think the
reason we see ice ages only recently is only because we don't have
enough data from earlier to see these relatively quick fluctuations.
By about 2 Mya the ice ages have settled into a rhythm, about one
every 40,000 years. About 800,000 years ago, the ice ages slow down -
we only get one every hundred thousand years. We also see that the ice
builds up slowly but disappears quickly.</p>
<p>We don't have a perfect answer for why these ice ages have such
periodicity, and why the periodicity would change. We do think,
however, that the interplay between our (slightly) eccentric orbit and
our axial tilt is important. Right now, for example, winter for the
Northern Hemisphere is when Earth is closest to the sun - so the
winters are slightly warmer than they would be if the opposite were
true. More on this stuff later (in this article, even!). All this was
first formulated by a guy called Milankovic, and there is still active
research on how these Milankovic cycles affect climate on Earth. We
can even use Milankovic cycles to think about Mars, but we have so
little paleoclimate data for Mars that we can't really make any
detailed conclusions.</p>
<p>Much of what we know about ice ages comes from ice cores in the
Antarctic and Greenland. We can look at the isotopes of water, as well
as the composition of air trapped in ice bubbles. We see that the
CO<sub>2</sub> fluctuations sync up well with the temperature
fluctuations. We're not sure why there is such a CO<sub>2</sub> cycle,
and if it causes or is caused by the ice ages, or if there is a causal
relationship at all. But we do know that CO<sub>2</sub> is a
greenhouse gas and does warm the Earth, and a decrease in
CO<sub>2</sub> will decrease the temperature.</p>
<p>In the Greenland ice cores we see that there's been significant
temperature variation on the scale of about 1000 years throughout the
past 100,000 years. This activity, called "millenial variability," is
especially prominent between 60,000 and 10,000 years ago. As we come
out of the most recent ice age, we see an abrupt warming event (called
the Bolling warm period), followed by an abrupt cooling event (called
the Younger Dryas), and then - stability. Ten thousand years of
relatively stable climate, known as the Holocene. You can see these
millenial variations below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/32/2/109/F1.large.jpg" /></p>
<h3><a name="1.11"></a>1.11 - Holocene Climate Variation</h3>
<p>Of course, the Holocene has been very short, so crazy climate
shenanigans have had no time to happen yet. But the suspicious lack of
millenial variation is worth investigating more, and there are still
points of interest in the Holocene.</p>
<p>Let's go back to Milankovic cycles, or, more broadly, the precession
cycles. The tilt-based seasons and the distance-based seasons line up
approximately once every 22,000 years. Currently, northern winter is
when the Earth is farthest from the sun, and vice versa. This gives
the northern hemisphere cooler summers and warmer winters. 11,000
years ago it was exactly opposite. However, for some reason, the
warmest northern summers occurred about seven thousand years ago, a
delay of some 4 thousand years. This time is called the "altithermal."
During this time summer temperatures were 2-4 C warmer than they are
now. The details of how the altithermal affected climate are active
subjects of research now.</p>
<p>The precessional cycle, perhaps unsurprisingly, affected precipitation
patterns in the lower latitudes. The Sahara was wet (well, wet enough
to be savannah grassland) from about 14,500 years ago to 4700 years
ago. There is also some evidence that mountain glaciers are also
related to the precessional cycle - the glaciers on Kilimanjaro were
laid down when the Sahara was wet, for example.</p>
<p>There is also the Little Ice Age, which was a time from about
1500-1800 during which temperate climes in the northern hemisphere
were cooled by about 0.5 C. We think this is because of a transient
dimming of the Sun, but there are many other factors that may be
involved. Because this is such a subtle effect, the principles behind
it are harder to coax out.</p>
<h3><a name="1.12"></a>1.12 - Back to Home: Global Warming</h3>
<p>So we know that CO<sub>2</sub> has has a big effect on the climate
throughout Earth's history. We also know that life has had an impact
on the carbon cycle. Much organic carbon has been sequestered without
oxidizing over the past billions of years. Now we are digging some
specific forms of this up and oxidizing millions of years' worth of
sequestered carbon in a few centuries.</p>
<p>We are substantially affecting the carbon cycle. Don't let anyone tell
you otherwise. We output 8 gigatonnes of carbon in 2005, and
this rate has been growing since then. There were about 600 gigatonnes
in the atmosphere in pre-industrial times, so that doesn't sound like
too much. But this means that at 2005 levels, we would be doubling the
amount of carbon in the atmosphere in 75 years.</p>
<p>Plants worldwide "fix" about 50 gigatonnes of carbon each year, but
only 0.4 gigatonnes per year are truly sequestered, with the rest being
recycled into the air by bacteria. The natural outgassing of
CO<sub>2</sub> leads to about 0.1 gigatonnes per year. Our output of 8
gigatonnes per year completely dwarfs these fluxes.</p>
<p>The oceans have acted as a buffer for us, absorbing about half of the
carbon we have emitted to date. The rate at which this happens,
however, depends on the mixing between the upper and deep ocean. If we
stopped burning fossil fuels today, it would take about 600 years for
the ocean to absorb 80% of the excess CO<sub>2</sub> in the
atmosphere. Even with the oceans taking up carbon as quickly as
possible we have enough fossil fuels to get the atmosphere up to 6
times the pre-industrial carbon dioxide concentration.</p>
<p>This leads to many questions: how much will the Earth warm exactly?
Where will this warming happen? How does this affect sea levels? Rain?
Civilization? The basic science behind these is well-developed, but
the details and granularity we need to answer these questions requires
a deeper understanding.</p>
<p>People started thinking about the science of global warming in the
19th century, but we didn't really have the data until the 70's and
80's to verify that, indeed, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> was rising and
the global temperature with it.</p>
<p>Between 1920 and 2005 the temperature has gone up 1 C. There was a
pause from about 1940 to 1970 because burning coal releases sulfur
compounds which reflect the sun, but then this mitigating effect was
overpowered by increased CO<sub>2</sub> and thus we see more
temperature rise.</p>
<p>Other complicating factors include the behavior of water vapor,
another strong greenhouse gas, in a warmer atmosphere, and the
combined warming/cooling effect of clouds. Clouds both insulate the
Earth and reflect sunlight, and the extent to which these balance each
other out is determined by the type of cloud. There are many other
complications as well in the problem of determining exactly what
happens to the Earth at +2 C or +4 C.</p>
<p>We do know that it is something of geologic proportion happening on a
human time-scale. In the distant future climate scientists will be
left to puzzle over this abrupt spike in atmospheric carbon.</p>
<h3><a name="1.13"</a>1.13 - The Fate of the Earth and the Lifetime of Biospheres</h3>
<p>No place can be habitable forever. Eventually the Sun will become a
red giant and engulf the Earth. Long before that it will be too bright
for our weathering process to compensate and we'll run into a runaway
greenhouse effect. Even before then, to maintain a habitable
temperature we'd need incredibly low amounts of atmospheric
CO<sub>2</sub>, which cripples photosynthesis.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could run out of CO<sub>2</sub> outgassing from the
Earth, and as we bury it all in the crust the Earth will freeze over.</p>
<p>And that's why I'm reading this book, because I want to learn more
about this crazy world we live in and maybe figure out ways to keep it
healthy.</p>
